          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri as{" "}
            <span className="people">Marshall Bruce Mathers III</span>, Eminem
            had a difficult upbringing. His mother,{" "}
            <span className="people">Deborah (Debbie) Rae Nelson</span>, nearly
            died during her 73-hour labor. His father,{" "}
            <span className="people">Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr.</span>, left him
            when he was just a year and a half old, leading him and his mother
            to fend off for themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the age of 12, he and his mother shuttled between a large number
            of states before finally settling in Detroit, Michigan. This led to
            him being the target of countless acts of bullying, which sprung
            from him always being viewed as the new kid.
          </p>
          <p>
            At age 14, Eminem would sneak into <em>Osborn High School</em> with
            friend and fellow rapper <span className="people">Proof</span> for
            lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On saturdays, they attended open
            mic contests at the <em>Hip-Hop Show</em> on West 7 Mile Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            After speding three years in 9th grade due to truancy and poor
            grades, 17-year-old Eminem dropped out of{" "}
            <em>Lincoln High School</em>. He'd work at several jobs to help his
            mother pay the bills. However, later on he stated that his mother
            would often throw him out of the house, taking most of his paycheck
            in the process.

          <h2>Early Career</h2>
          <p>
            In 1988, Eminem - who went by the name{" "}
            <span className="people">MC Double M</span> - formed his first group
            (<span className="people">New Jacks</span>) and made a self-titled
            demo tape with DJ <span className="people">Butter Fingers</span>. In
            1989, they joined <em>Bassmint Productions</em> - who later changed
            their name to <span className="people">Soul Intent</span> - with{" "}
            <span className="people">Proof</span> and other childhood friends.
            In 1996, Eminem and <span className="people">Proof</span> teamed up
            with four other rappers to form{" "}
            <span className="people">The Dirty Dozen (D12)</span>, who released{" "}
            <em>The Underground E.P.</em> in 1997 and their first album,{" "}
            <em>Devil's Night</em>, in 2001.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1995, Eminem was signed to{" "}
            <span className="people">Jeff and Mark Bass'</span>{" "}
            <em>F.B.T. Productions</em> and, in 1995-1996, recorded his debut
            album <em>Infinite</em> for their independent{" "}
            <em>Web Entertainment</em> label. Upon its release, the album was a
            commercial failure, with Detroit disc jockeys largely ignoring it.
            This led Eminem to craft angrier and moodier tracks.

          <h2> Introduction of Slim Shady and Rise to Succes</h2>
          <p>
            Eminem attracted more attention when he developed{" "}
            <span className="people">Slim Shady</span>, a sadistic, violent
            alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with
            lyrics about drugs, rape and murder. In the spring of 1997, he
            recorded his debut EP, the <em>Slim Shady EP</em>, which was
            released that winter by <em>Web Entertainment</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After he was fired from his job as a dishwasher at{" "}
            <em>Gilbert's Lodge</em> and evicted from his home, Eminem went to
            Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 <em>Rap Olympics</em>, a
            nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, losing to{" "}
            <em>Project Blowed</em> <span className="people">MC Otherwize</span>
            , however an <em>Interscope Records</em> intern named{" "}
            <span className="people">Dean Geistlinger</span> was in attendance
            and asked Eminem for a copy of the <em>Slim Shady EP</em>, copy
            which would later arrived to company's CEO,{" "}
            <span className="people">Jimmy Iovine</span>, hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iovine played the tape for record producer{" "}
            <span className="people">Dr. Dre</span>, who recalled telling Iovine{" "}
            <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminem">
              In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found
              anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said,
              'Find him. Now.'
            </q>{" "}
            That's how, on March 9, 1998, Eminem got signed to{" "}
            <em>Aftermath</em> and
            <em>Interscope</em>, and well, the rest is history. Eminem would go
            on to become one of the best-selling artists of all time and be
            regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time.
